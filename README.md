# MobilePantryOptimization
An equity-based decision model for mobile pantry locations

Hunger-relief operations play a vital role in achieving sustainable development goals
by reducing hunger issues. Food banks distribute
donated foods to local pantries in the current hunger-relief spectrum. However, because of the location and distance con-
straints, pantries fail to serve all food-insecure locations. Mobile pantries or pop-up
pantries can play an essential role in mitigating the gap in the existing hunger-relief
supply chain. A set covering approach usually does not consider the equity constraint,
that is, allocating their fare share of items. In this project, we develop a mixed inte-
ger linear programming model (MILP) to strategically locate a minimum number of
mobile pantries to maximize the coverage of food-insecure locations equitably. Using
Food Insecurity Data from the United States Census Bureauâ€™s Pulse Survey, we also
incorporate equity in our model to serve the people who need it more. Our proposed
solution can help decision-makers locate mobile pantries in strategic locations and step
forward towards achieving zero hunger.
